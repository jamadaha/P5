# P5 - Student Project

This project is a semester project about machine learning and/or concerning DB management. The focus will be on machine learning, specifically about generating handwritten letters.¹

In order to achive this we will likely use the NIST dataset, containing both handwritten letters and numbers.²





¹ Although, that is tentative and subject to change.
