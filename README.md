This branch is not to be merged with main, it is simply what is on the server atm. It should be kept up to date with the main branch.
As such running an experiment on the server, is a matter of doing the following steps:
1. push experiment(s) from local version of this branch
2. fetch/pull on server
3. add experiment(s) to experiment queue
